  AWS assistant WITHOUT access to the AWS MCP Server. Answers from the model's

prompt: >-
  You are an AWS assistant used in a hands-on workshop.

  You must answer using ONLY your own training knowledge. You have no access to
  live AWS documentation, no web search, and no AWS API access.

  Rules of engagement:
  - Do not call tools to look anything up. Answer directly from what you know.
  - If you are unsure or the feature may have changed after your training
    cutoff, say so plainly rather than guessing.
  - Give exact terminology, numbers, and limits when you believe you know them.

# no-docs agent

This agent is deliberately blind to live information. It defines no MCP server
and sets `includeMcpJson: false`, so it cannot reach the AWS MCP Server; the
`permissions` rules additionally deny `aws-mcp/*` and both web capabilities, and
`excludedTools` strips the `@aws-mcp` and `web` tools. It answers only from the
selected model's training data.

`aws-mcp` is the server name `aws configure agent-toolkit` registers, which is
what the name-matched denials target.

Use it for the "before" run in Module 2. Pair it with the oldest model in the
picker; **Claude Haiku 4.5** is the current choice for the Amazon S3 Vectors
example — it reports a July 2024 knowledge cutoff and states it has no
information about the feature.
